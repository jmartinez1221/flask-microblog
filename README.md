# Microblog using Flask

This repository represents my refresher for Flask development. 
The app created in this repository exercises the following skills
* Python fundamentals
* Web application hosting
* Database management and migration via ORM syntax
* HTML and CSS styling
* Security considerations for user management

## Installation

It is highly recommended to create a python virtual in which to manage the dependencies of this project.
This repo was created using Python 3.9.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, open up a terminal.

```shell
flask run
```

This will run the flask application and expose it to port 5000
```shell
http://localhost:5000
```

At this point, feel free to interact with the application as you wish.
